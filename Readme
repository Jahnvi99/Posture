Analysis of human posture has many applications in the field of sports and medical science including patient monitoring, lifestyle analysis, elderly care etc. It is important to understand if a person is healthy (in terms of his everyday posture) or is suffering with a joint/bone disease as reflected by his incorrect posture. This project aims to classify the posture during three different activities (standing, sitting and sleeping/lying) as a healthy or unhealthy one. This is done by applying deep learning techniques on a large posture dataset which is collected with the help of MPU-6050 sensors mounted on multiple positions on the body. After the training of the deep learning model is complete, the model is embedded in a mobile application for classifying the posture of a person as healthy/unhealthy and notifying the subject about it in real-time. This can be very useful in monitoring day to day health and lifestyle of any person.
